The following code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error in Firebase related to data retrieval and asynchronous operations. The issue arises when attempting to access data from a Firebase Realtime Database query before the query has completed. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as undefined values or crashes.

```javascript
const database = firebase.database();
const query = database.ref('users').orderByChild('name').equalTo('John');

query.on('value', (snapshot) => {
  const users = snapshot.val();
  console.log(users); // This might log null or undefined if not handled correctly
});

// Attempting to access users before the query completes will lead to an error
console.log(users); // This will likely log undefined
```
