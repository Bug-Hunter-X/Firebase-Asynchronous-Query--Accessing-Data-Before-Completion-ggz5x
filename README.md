# Firebase Asynchronous Query: Handling Data Before Completion

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error related to asynchronous data retrieval in Firebase Realtime Database. The problem arises from attempting to access data from a database query before the query has finished executing. This can result in unexpected null or undefined values, potentially leading to app crashes.

## The Problem
The provided `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code. The query fetches data, but an attempt to use the data is made before the query's completion, causing undefined results.

## Solution
The solution, in `bugSolution.js`, addresses the asynchronous nature of the Firebase query using a promise or async/await to guarantee data access after the query completes successfully.
